### SwiftUI滚动框架，修改以适配**iOS14**。


This iOS application is an example implementation of dynamic tabs with SwiftUI. The UI includes a tab view at the top, with four tabs showcasing different colors. As the user scrolls horizontally through the tabs, a line indicator moves to track the currently selected tab.<br>
